# Module 1

**Ruby for Intermediate** program is a coding bootcamp by [Gojek's GoAcademy](https://www.gojek.com/go-academy/) and [Generation Girl](https://www.generationgirl.org/).

The curriculum is designed with the aim to introduce the fundamentals of software development and developing a web application with unit test and follow F.I.R.S.T principles.
We learn the theory and numerous practical exercises in the program.

In the second class of *Intermediate* level, we:
* Showcase and discuss Module 0's Homework
* Learn about Database
    * Define the attribute of an entity
    * Learn database cardinality
    * Create Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
    * Create database schema using SQL (we use MySQL)
    * Do simple query database (CRUD query)
    * Do join query

For our Homework, we practice everything we learned from the class by creating Food Order Management System database using MySQL.
