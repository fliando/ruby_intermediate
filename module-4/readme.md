# Module 4

**Ruby for Intermediate** program is a coding bootcamp by [Gojek's GoAcademy](https://www.gojek.com/go-academy/) and [Generation Girl](https://www.generationgirl.org/).

The curriculum is designed with the aim to introduce the fundamentals of software development and developing a web application with unit test and follow F.I.R.S.T principles.
We learn the theory and numerous practical exercises in the program.

In the fifth class of *Intermediate* level, we:
* Showcase and discuss Module 3's Homework (MVC Architecture)
* Learn about Unit Test
    * What Unit Test is and why it is important
    * Learn about F.I.R.S.T principle of testing
      * Fast: write test that is simple and can run fast
      * Independent/Isolated: write test that should not depend on other test cases
      * Repeatable: write test that can run multiple times in any environment and still produce the same result
      * Self-validating: write test that have no manual validation need after running test
      * Timely/Thorough:
        * Timely: write test before implement the code (TDD approach)
        * Thorough: write test for many cases, where we can trust the unit test to verify the implementation thoroughly
    * Learn to use RSpec (Ruby Test framework) / use Ruby gem 'rspec'
    * Learn about Unit Test for Model and Controller
